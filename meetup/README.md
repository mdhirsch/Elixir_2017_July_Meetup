# Meetup

These are the modules to be used in my talk to the Elixir meetup in Boulder on July 11, 2017

There are notes on how to run the examples in notes.txt

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `meetup` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:meetup, "~> 0.1.0"}]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/meetup](https://hexdocs.pm/meetup).
